## What is PxeLab

**PxeLab** is an all-in-one PXE network boot server that integrates DHCP, TFTP, HTTP, DNS, and NFS services into a single binary, managed through a modern Web UI and REST API.

Traditional PXE deployments require installing and configuring multiple services (DHCP, TFTP, HTTP, etc.) separately — a process that's tedious and error-prone. PxeLab simplifies everything into one executable: download, run, and start using. Whether you're doing batch OS deployment, diskless workstation setup, or daily server maintenance, PxeLab provides an efficient and reliable network boot solution.
